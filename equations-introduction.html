            <h1>The Foundation: What is an Equation?</h1>
            <p>An equation is a mathematical statement that says two things are equal. Think of it like a perfectly balanced scale. Everything on the left side of the equals sign ($=$) must have the exact same value as everything on the right side.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <strong>The Equals Sign:</strong> The equals sign was invented in 1557 by a Welsh mathematician named Robert Recorde, who got tired of writing "is equal to" over and over!

            <h3>Essential Vocabulary</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variable:</strong> A symbol (like $x$) that represents a number we don't know yet. It's a mystery we need to solve!</li>
                <li><strong>Constant:</strong> A number that stands on its own, whose value is known (like $5$ or $-12$).</li>
                <li><strong>Expression:</strong> A group of terms (like $2x + 5$) that represents a value. An equation is made of two expressions set equal to each other.</li>
            </ul>

                <summary><strong>Question 1:</strong> Is $7 + 3 > 9$ an equation?</summary>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> No. It is an inequality because it uses a "greater than" symbol ($>$), not an equals sign ($=$).</p>
            </details>
            <details>
                <summary><strong>Question 2:</strong> In the equation $4a - 7 = 13$, what is the variable?</summary>
                <p class="answer"><strong>Answer:</strong> The variable is $a$. It's the unknown value we need to find to make the equation true.</p>
