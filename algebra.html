            <h1>Algebra: The Science of Generalization</h1>
            <p>At its heart, algebra is the powerful art of using symbols to generalize rules and relationships. This page covers the foundational concepts of solving for unknowns and understanding the relationships between variables.</p>
        </article>

        <section class="lesson-section">
            <h2>Part 1: Equations & Inequalities</h2>
            <p>This section focuses on the toolkit for solving for unknown values. An equation is like a balanced scale, and our goal is to find the value that keeps it in balance.</p>

            <h3>The Foundation: What is an Equation?</h3>
            <p>An equation states that two expressions are equal (e.g., $x+3=5$). Our goal is to find the value of the <strong>variable</strong> (the symbol, like $x$) that makes this statement true. We do this by keeping the "scale" balanced.</p>

            <h3>One-Step & Two-Step Equations</h3>
            <p>We solve equations using <strong>inverse operations</strong> to isolate the variable. Addition undoes subtraction, and multiplication undoes division. For two-step equations, we reverse the order of operations (undoing addition/subtraction first).</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Example (Two-Step):</strong> Solve $3x - 4 = 11$.<br>
            1. Add 4 to both sides: $3x = 15$.<br>
            2. Divide both sides by 3: $x = 5$.
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Multi-Step & Special Cases</h3>
            <p>For more complex equations, we first simplify by <strong>combining like terms</strong> or using the <strong>distributive property</strong> to remove parentheses. Sometimes, the variables will cancel out, leading to a true statement like $5=5$ (Infinite Solutions) or a false statement like $5=2$ (No Solution).</p>

            <h3>Inequalities</h3>
            <p>Inequalities (using $<, >$) are solved just like equations, with one golden rule: <strong>when you multiply or divide both sides by a negative number, you must flip the inequality sign.</strong></p>
            <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong> Solve $-2x > 10$.<br>
            Divide by -2 and flip the sign: $x < -5$.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Part 2: Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions describe a specific relationship between an input and an output. For every one input, there is exactly one output.</p>

            <h3>What is a Function?</h3>
            <p>Think of a function as a machine. You put an input (like a number) in, the machine follows a rule, and it produces a single output. We can use the <strong>Vertical Line Test</strong> on a graph to see if it's a function: if a vertical line touches the graph more than once, it's not a function.</p>

            <h3>Function Notation</h3>
            <p>We use the notation $f(x)$ (read "f of x") to represent a function. This is a replacement for 'y' that makes the input-output relationship clear.</p>
            <blockquote><strong>Example:</strong> If $f(x) = x^2 + 2$, find $f(3)$.<br>
            Replace x with 3: $f(3) = (3)^2 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11$.
