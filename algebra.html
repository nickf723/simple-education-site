            <h1>Algebra: The Science of Generalization</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Algebra. At its heart, algebra isn't just about solving for $x$; it's the powerful art of using symbols to generalize rules and relationships. It allows us to move from specific calculations (like $3 + 4 = 7$) to universal principles (like $a + b = b + a$) that hold true for all numbers.</p>

            <strong>Starting Point:</strong> A solid grasp of Arithmetic is the foundation upon which all of algebra is built.

            <h2>What Are We Building With?</h2>
            <p>Algebra gives us a language to describe patterns and solve puzzles. The basic building blocks of this language are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variables ($x, y, a, b$):</strong> Symbols that act as placeholders for numbers we don't know yet, or for quantities that can change.</li>
                <li><strong>Expressions ($2x - 3$):</strong> Combinations of variables, numbers, and operations that represent a value.</li>
                <li><strong>Equations ($2x - 3 = 7$):</strong> A statement that two expressions are equal, forming a complete "sentence" that we can often solve.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3>The Core Goals of Algebra</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Solving for the Unknown:</strong> Finding the value of a variable that makes an equation true.</li>
                <li><strong>Modeling Relationships:</strong> Using functions and equations to describe real-world phenomena, like the path of a thrown ball.</li>
                <li><strong>Understanding Structure:</strong> Exploring the properties of mathematical systems and how they fit together.</li>
            </ul>
