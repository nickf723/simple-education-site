            <h1>Solving One-Step Equations</h1>
            <p>Our goal is to figure out the value of the unknown variable. To do this, we need to get the variable by itself on one side of the equals sign. We use <strong>inverse operations</strong> to undo what's being done to the variable.</p>

            <strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Whatever you do to one side of the equation, you MUST do to the other side to keep it balanced!

            <h2>1. Solving with Addition & Subtraction</h2>
            <p>Addition and subtraction are inverse operations. To undo subtraction, you add. To undo addition, you subtract.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve for $x$ in $x + 5 = 12$.</p>
            <p>The variable $x$ is having 5 added to it. To undo this, we subtract 5 from both sides:</p>
            $$ x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5 $$
            $$ x = 7 $$

            <h2>2. Solving with Multiplication & Division</h2>
            <p>Multiplication and division are inverse operations. To undo division, you multiply. To undo multiplication, you divide.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve for $y$ in $4y = 20$.</p>
            <p>The variable $y$ is being multiplied by 4. To undo this, we divide both sides by 4:</p>
            $$ \frac{4y}{4} = \frac{20}{4} $$
            $$ y = 5 $$
